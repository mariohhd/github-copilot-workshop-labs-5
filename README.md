# GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

This repository contains a collection of challenges to improve your skills with GitHub Copilot to understand and distinguish between Copilot modes: Autocompletion, Chat, and Agent.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other editor that supports GitHub Copilot.
- [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) extensions installed.
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pytest
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code or your favorite editor.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtual environment.
4. Run the application using `uvicorn app.app:app --reload` or `python app/app.py` (virtual environment is already configured).
5. Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (Swagger UI) or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` (ReDoc).
6. Test the API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.

## Challenges

### 1.- Basic Copilot Usage

**Objective**: Explore GitHub Copilot's autocompletion (classic mode).

**Instructions**:
1. Open the `employee.py` file.
2. Place the cursor inside the `modify_employee` method.
3. Write a comment like: `// Improve performance of the method`.
4. Observe the suggestions Copilot offers you.
5. Accept the suggestion you consider most appropriate.
6. Create a new method by writing a comment like: `// Create a method to fetch employees by department`.
7. Observe the suggestions Copilot offers you.

### 2.- Using Copilot Chat in Ask or Edit Mode
**Objective**: Experiment with Copilot Chat to solve doubts and generate more complex code.

**Instructions**:
1. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+' in VS Code)
2. Open the `employee.py` file.
3. Ask Copilot in Ask mode: `How can I improve this class use dependency injection?`
4. Review the explanation. Select another model and compare the answers.
5. Now, in Edit mode, select the `add_employee` method and ask Copilot to rewrite it to use data validations.
6. Review the suggestions and code generated by Copilot.
7. Make sure the code is correct and functional.

### 3.- Using Copilot Agent Mode
**Objective**: Use Copilot Agent mode to generate code based on more complex instructions.

**Instructions**:
1. Access Agent Mode via the VS Code command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), then search for “Copilot Agent: ...”, or use the dedicated icon.
2. Let's pose a high-level task: `Refactor the entire project to use FastAPI instead of Flask`.
3. Review the suggestions and code generated by Copilot.
4. Now try another task: `Implement JWT authentication for the API`.
5. Review the suggestions and code generated by Copilot.
6. Interact with the agent to ask questions or request clarifications.

### 4.- Chat modes
**Objective**: Experiment with Custom chat modes that define specific behaviors and tools for GitHub Copilot Chat, enabling enhanced context-aware assistance for particular tasks or workflows.

**Instructions**:
1. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+' in VS Code).
2. Explore the different available chat modes and how they can help you in your workflow in this repository https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/README.chatmodes.md
4. Create `Best Mode` in VS Code using the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and selecting "Chat: New Model chat" and pasting the content from the `Best Mode` chat mode to get more precise and detailed answers, which you can find at https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/chatmodes/4.1-Beast.chatmode.md
5. Try using a specific chat mode for a particular task, such as code generation or solving doubts.
6. Compare the results obtained with different chat modes and adjust your approach as needed.

### 5.- Computer Vision in multimodal models
**Objective**: Explore the capabilities of multimodal models that can process and understand both text and images.

**Instructions**:
1. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+' in VS Code).
2. Add the image `EmployeeManagementUI.png` located in this folder to the chat by dragging and dropping it into the chat window.
3. Ask Copilot to implement a web-based user interface for the Employee Management System based on the provided image.
4. Review the suggestions and code generated by Copilot.
5. Make sure the code is correct and functional.

# 🎁 Bonus Track

In this section, you’ll explore **GitHub Copilot Coding Agent** in action. Follow these steps to try it out:  

1. **Download** the following repository: *[https://github.com/Geronimo-Basso/github-coding-agent-demo]*
2. **Create** a new Git repo with the code and upload it to GitHub.
3. **Explore** the repository briefly — you can even ask Copilot directly on GitHub to explain parts of the code.  
4. **Create a new issue** in the repository. We suggest naming it:  
   > **Add height and weight filters to player directory interface**  

   You can structure the issue like this (or adapt it as you prefer):  

   **Summary**  
   Add UI controls and filtering logic so users can filter NBA players by height and weight in the Streamlit interface.  

   **Motivation**  
   Users can currently filter by name, team, school, country, position, and draft year. Adding height and weight filters will make it easier to search by physical attributes.  

   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - Add height and weight sliders (min/max or range) to the sidebar.  
   - Filter results update immediately when adjusted.  
   - Include only players whose values fall within the selected range.  
   - Display units clearly (e.g., inches, pounds).  
   - Handle edge cases (invalid ranges, missing data, etc.).  

   **Implementation Notes**  
   - Check `nba-mock-data/players.csv` for column names and units.  
   - Filtering happens client-side since the CSV is loaded in memory.  
   - Add proper validation and unit labels in the UI.  
   - Update the README with details about the new filters.  

5. **Assign the issue** to **GitHub Copilot Agent**.  
6. **Observe and review** how Copilot handles the implementation.  
7. **Merge** the changes once ready — and don’t stop there! Try asking Copilot for more improvements or creative additions.  

## Expected API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/employees` - List all employees
- `POST /api/v1/employees` - Add a new employee
- `DELETE /api/v1/employees/{id}` - Delete an employee by ID

## API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation:
